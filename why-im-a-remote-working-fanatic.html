            <p>I&#8217;m often approached by recruiters, and in general I&#8217;m always happy to listen to
potential opportunities and have a chat.
However more often than not I don&#8217;t take it any further unless the organisation
has embraced remote&nbsp;working.</p>
<p><strong>I freakin&#8217; love remote-working</strong> and I&#8217;d find it incredibly hard to give up.<br>
I&#8217;ll do everything I can to make it an option for more organisations and&nbsp;individuals.</p>
<p>Just as well I work in developing telepresence and collaboration&nbsp;tools!</p>
<p>As I rant on about this a lot I&#8217;ve written this post to explain why I&#8217;m a
remote working&nbsp;fanatic. </p>
<h1>The obvious personal&nbsp;benefits</h1>
<p>There are obvious benefits to my personal&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Firstly I have a huge amount of flexibility for how I structure my day.
I fundamentally believe that Engineering and Programming are creative pursuits,
and creativity suffers in a traditional rigid 9-to-5 commute-heavy grey office&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>At home (or wherever I choose to work on a given day) I can be in my ideal
workspace; I have everything setup in the way that&#8217;s most efficient for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Having complete control over my environment extends to distractions.
We all know how painful it can be to have one&#8217;s concentration broken when
working on a particularly difficult bug.
When remote working that&#8217;s not an issue; if I want to blast out some Rammstein
while work then I can, if I want some silence to concentrate without
distractions then I can do that&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>I can use long periods of dead time, e.g. long compiles or test runs, to get
some chores done, or indulge in some woodwork (my current hobby of the week).
As a result I tend to work later than I would if I was in an office, but not at
the cost of my overall personal time.
Both myself and my employer benefit from this more efficient use of my&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The lack of a commute also saves me a lot of time, money and effort, which I can
then reinvest in my work and in my personal&nbsp;life.</p>
<p><strong>In summary remote working allows me to work happier, harder, more efficiently
with less personal and financial&nbsp;cost.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://chris.scutcher.uk/images/ex-60.jpg" title="At home I use the wonderful EX60" height="200" width="200" alt="At home I use the wonderful EX60" class="fig-right"></p>
<h1>Remote working can change the&nbsp;world</h1>
<p>Aside from the personal benefits, I genuinely believe that, if it was adopted
widely, remote working can radically change the world for the betterment of&nbsp;everyone.</p>
<p>The strain on <strong>transport networks</strong> would be seriously reduced.
Those remote working would no longer have to waste hours of their life packed
onto overcrowded trains and roads.
Those who still have to go to their place of work for practical reasons would
have a much better time as the pressure on transport would be reduced,
especially around peak&nbsp;times.</p>
<p>This obviously also has a massive benefit for the <strong>environment</strong>.
Apart from reducing the need to commute, normalising distributed remote working
also reduces the need for international travel for&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>There are tremendous benefits for <strong>family life</strong> too.
Without the commute there&#8217;s more time to spend with loved ones, and the
additional flexibility will help get more mothers back to work if that&#8217;s their&nbsp;wish.</p>
<p>Those with <strong>disabilities</strong>, physical or otherwise, will find it easier to enter
and thrive in the job&nbsp;market. </p>
<p>Slashing our dependence on traditional office spaces will also help tackle the
<strong>housing crisis</strong> by freeing up more land for&nbsp;homes.</p>
<p>Not having to live close to where you work will also encourage us to spread out
a little more, so we don&#8217;t all have to pack into London, 
<strong>revitalising the north</strong> (and other areas) of the country and easing
stratospheric housing prices and strain on services in London and the&nbsp;South. </p>
<p>Internationally it could help benefit developing countries by tackling
<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital_flight">brain drain</a></strong> by allowing skilled individuals
from developing countries to live in and contribute to their home&nbsp;countries. </p>
<p>Finally, distributed working environments go further to break down the
artificial walls that separate us.
Working together across international boundaries helps us remember that we&#8217;re
<strong>all in it together</strong> and that just because someone lives on a different
continent doesn&#8217;t make them less&nbsp;important.</p>
<h1>Benefits to the&nbsp;employers</h1>
<p>There are huge benefits to the employer as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>First and foremost your employees will be happier, healthier, more creative and
more productive. 
Not only is this directly beneficial but it also makes you look like an
innovative, forward-thinking, ethical company that puts its trust in its
employees and values all the things I mention&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>Secondly, you&#8217;ll find it easier to hire and retain the best employees;
the engineer with the ideal experience for your project lives in Germany - no 
problem!
Your <span class="caps">QA</span> lead wants to move back to Portugal to be with her family - relax!
That&#8217;s aside from the fact that you&#8217;ll be a lot more attractive as a place to&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there are obvious savings to be made by no longer paying for the
traditional office buildings and&nbsp;infrastructure.</p>
<p>Lastly, the improvements made when implementing home-working, such as better
collaboration tools and better monitoring of employee performance, will bring
tangible benefits elsewhere in your&nbsp;organisations.</p>
<h1>But what about the&nbsp;downsides?</h1>
<p>People hugely overstate the downsides of remote working. I&#8217;ll tackle a few&nbsp;here.</p>
<h2>Not trusting&nbsp;people</h2>
<p>Depressingly, the most common criticism I hear goes like&nbsp;this;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;If people are working from home, they&#39;ll slack off.&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>I&#8217;d respond like this: if the only way you know someone is working is because
they&#8217;re sitting at their desk then you&#8217;ve already lost.
Someone being physically present has literally no affect on how hard they&#8217;re
working, especially in the age of facebook and smartphones.
There are plenty of ways to slack off in an office&nbsp;undetected.</p>
<p>The inability to accurately gauge an employees&#8217; performance suggests, more than
anything else, poor management.
However, even if this isn&#8217;t the case, how exactly is seeing bums on seats&nbsp;helping?</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;d say you&#8217;d get more productive, efficient and enthusiastic employees by
creating a positive, trusting environment that gives feedback based on actual
performance rather than how many hours someone&#8217;s been at their&nbsp;desk.</strong></p>
<h2><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Face-to-face is&nbsp;everything!&#8221;</h2>
<p>Traditional, old fashioned, face-to-face communication still has its place, but
almost all of those benefits can be kept in a remote working&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m lucky enough to have been working primarily from home now for ~5 years and
I would say that, when it comes to communication and collaboration, remote
working is almost always as good, if not better, than being&nbsp;co-located.</strong></p>
<p>Telepresence technology is fantastic now. I have an
<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/collaboration-endpoints/telepresence-ex60/model.html"><span class="caps">EX60</span></a>
on my desk and use it all the time.
It&#8217;s actually out of date now, but still provides a fantastic&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m in a call it&#8217;s like the person I&#8217;m talking to is in the room.
The audio is crystal clear, and even when I get up and walk around I can still
continue the conversation&nbsp;naturally. </p>
<p>People often think those useful &#8220;over-the-shoulder&#8221; conversations are
compromised with remote working. I don&#8217;t believe this is the case.
Firstly, much of that can be preserved with simple tools like Slack, or Spark,
or even <span class="caps">IRC</span>.
Secondly, my colleagues and I often have calls or conferences open for hours at
a time, not for any particular conversation, but just for the social aspect or
to have the company, and it works&nbsp;great.</p>
<p>Other collaboration tools such as shared terminals and virtual whiteboards
often provide a better experience than the &#8220;real-world&#8221; equivalents. 
Buddy coding around one keyboard can be cramped and uncomfortable, but doing so
on a video call, using tmux to share the terminal, is far&nbsp;superior. </p>
<p>With more innovations on the way, in particular around <span class="caps">VR</span> and augmented reality,
I believe we&#8217;ll see more and more ways that technology will allow us to
communicate and collaborate better than we ever could face to face.
Indeed, the best innovations will come when we fully embrace technology&#8217;s
ability to allow communication in a way that&#8217;s impossible with a physical
analogue.
This is something I&#8217;ve been experimenting with, developing <span class="caps">VR</span>-based virtual
meeting spaces with the <span class="caps">HTC</span>&nbsp;Vive. </p>
<p><img alt="With VR the possibilities for virtual collaboration are endless)" src="http://chris.scutcher.uk/images/fantastic-contraption.gif"></p>
<h2><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>But I like going into the&nbsp;office&#8221;</h2>
<p>Some people like going into the office.
They might find it difficult to work at home, or like the change of scenery, or
would miss the social&nbsp;aspect. </p>
<p>But embracing remote working doesn&#8217;t have to mean you can&#8217;t have that stuff if
you want it. Actually, it can make it even&nbsp;better!</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to work at home, remote working still opens up so many
options. Maybe you&#8217;d like to work from a café or an art gallery.
How about a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace">hackerspaces</a>?</p>
<p>Or if you&#8217;d like a more traditional space, maybe find a shared office space
(sometimes called a co-office) close to your&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>These suggestions obviously also address the social aspect, with shared offices
and hackerspaces being especially useful as they also allow people excellent
opportunities to network and learn; but outside of that the additional
flexibility that comes with remote working makes it much easier to manage one&#8217;s
social life outside of work (<em><span class="caps">GASP</span></em>). It&#8217;s easier to grab lunch with an old
friend, or - now you don&#8217;t have to commute - join a club, take a class, go to
the gym&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>I would also add, despite having worked from home almost exclusively, I have a
good social relationship with the colleagues in my team and we often
meet up virtually in other ways (gaming) or going to the pub for&nbsp;realsies. </p>
<p><strong>Your working environment can be more social, more interesting, 
and more efficient. The choice is&nbsp;yours.</strong></p>
<h1>Remote Working is the&nbsp;Future</h1>
<p>As you can probably tell by this point, I really believe in&nbsp;home-working. </p>
<p>I won&#8217;t deny that, if you don&#8217;t already do it, there are challenges to
overcome in order to transition, but they can be overcome with the
technology and culture that exists today. 
The benefits will exceed any cost many times&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>I would like to ensure it continues to be an option for myself, but I also 
encourage everyone else to do whatever they can to embrace it themselves,
and in their&nbsp;organisations.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see the government do everything it can to encourage remote&nbsp;working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing in communication&nbsp;networks.</li>
<li>Encourage remote working where possible for all tax-payer funded&nbsp;jobs.</li>
<li>Incentivising companies to provide home-working options to&nbsp;employers.</li>
</ul>
